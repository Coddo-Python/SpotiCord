# SpotiCord
A dead project of mine
## What is it
It's a Music Bot for Discord and its made from scratch. But it was not supposed to be any ordinary bot. One of its main features would be that if one of your friends was listening to spotify, you could 'join their party' (listen to what their listening to, and if they change song, it'll change for you, etc), the reason that this was a big deal was because this is actually a spotify PREMIUM feature but it was being nearly flawlessly executed by the bot. *Nearly.*
# Why is it dead
Sadly, after exams passed I had completely forgotten and lost interest in this project and it rot away. After coming back to it, I realized that the code is SO outdated that it would require a full refactor and I am now working on other projects. So I leave this code for other people to look at. Keep in mind I made this in about 2020-2021 and so I was still learning Python!
